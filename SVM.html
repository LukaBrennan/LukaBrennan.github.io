            <h1>Iris flower predictions using the <strong>Support Vector Machine Model (SVM)</strong></h1>
            <p>A machine learning project that uses <strong>SVM's</strong> to predict the species of flower a iris is, based on the flower's <strong>sepal length</strong> and <strong>width</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <div class="project-content">
            <p><strong>Why choose this?</strong></p>
            <p>When searching for a suitable dataset to use for this project, I wanted to pick something that was <strong>interesting</strong> and could be used. The whole idea of this project is to be able to <strong>classify</strong> the flowers into their representative species.</p>         
            <p>The model shows how a <strong>"Target"</strong> interacts with <strong>"Features"</strong>. With this data, having a function in place to allow for <strong>user input</strong> will allow for an accurate prediction of the species of flower just based off of the <strong>length</strong> and <strong>width</strong> of the sepal.</p>             
            <p><strong>SVM's</strong> were selected for this project because of their ability to perform <strong>multi-class classification</strong>, as the <strong>"Target"</strong> variable in the dataset represents the species of flower. It works well with classifying which species the user input will belong to.</p>
            <p>From the dataset, the data that was used in this was, for the <strong>"Target"</strong>, all three species of iris flower, and for the <strong>"Feature"</strong>, just the <strong>sepal length</strong> and <strong>width</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Data Sources/Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>The <strong>iris dataset</strong> was taken from the <strong>sklearn.datasets</strong> using <strong>load_iris</strong>.</p>
        <p>There was <strong>no preprocessing</strong> done for this model, as the dataset was very <strong>clean</strong> and <strong>functional</strong>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="Data-Visualization" class="about">
        <h2>Data Visualization and Understanding</h2>
        <p>Using <strong>Python (Jupyter Notebook)</strong> and the import <strong>matplotlib.pyplot as plt</strong>, I visualized a single <strong>scatter plot</strong> diagram. Inside the scatter plot, it shows the three different <strong>Targets</strong>, which are <strong>color-coded</strong> to be able to distinguish them, as well as a <strong>legend</strong> to allow readers to identify them.</p>
        <p>Inside of the scatter plot, there are many different <strong>data points</strong> that can be seen. These points are all the different species that are located in the dataset.</p>
        <p>Also, a <strong>confusion matrix</strong> was constructed to observe the model's performance.</p>
        <p>Below are the <strong>Scatter plot</strong> and <strong>Confusion Matrix</strong> which were constructed:</p>

    <section id="Algorithms" class="about">
        <h2>Algorithms</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</strong> algorithm was used to classify the Iris dataset into its three species: <strong>Setosa</strong>, <strong>Versicolor</strong>, and <strong>Virginica</strong>. SVM is a <strong>supervised machine learning</strong> algorithm that works by finding the <strong>optimal hyperplane</strong> that best separates the data into different classes. The goal of SVM is to maximize the <strong>margin</strong> between the hyperplane and the nearest data points (called <strong>support vectors</strong>) from each class.</p>
        <p>In this project, a <strong>linear kernel</strong> was used, which assumes that the data can be separated by a <strong>straight line</strong> (or hyperplane in higher dimensions). The <strong>linear kernel</strong> was chosen because the Iris dataset is relatively <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>linearly separable</strong>, especially when using only two features (<strong>sepal length</strong> and <strong>sepal width</strong>). However, SVM can also handle <strong>non-linear decision boundaries</strong> using other kernels, such as the <strong>Radial Basis Function (RBF)</strong> or <strong>polynomial kernels</strong>.</p>
        <p>The SVM model was trained on <strong>80%</strong> of the dataset, with the remaining <strong>20%</strong> used for testing. The model achieved <strong>high accuracy</strong>, as demonstrated by the <strong>confusion matrix</strong> and <strong>classification report</strong>. The <strong>decision boundaries</strong> were visualized to better understand how the model separates the classes.</p>

        <h2>Online Sources</h2>
        <p>Two different online sources were mainly used in the creation of this SVM model. They were used as a foundation in order for the model to be built on:</p>
